### Project for Section 19: **Todo List Application with Core Data**  
This project was completed as part of Section 19 in the **Complete iOS Development Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

## Project Overview
**Todoey** is a simple yet effective todo list application that allows users to manage their tasks. The app utilizes Core Data for data persistence, providing users with the ability to add, check, and uncheck items.
